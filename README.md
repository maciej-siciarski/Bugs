## **Bugs Overview** üêû‚ùå 

A collection of previously encountered defects on the path towards transitioning to a software testing career. I am continuously seeking opportunities to discover more software bugs, which helps in further developing my skills.

## **Bug Reports**

Documentation that makes defect tracking easier, enabling developers to more effectively and quickly address unwanted issues. Constructed from basic elements such as:

- **Linked Test-Case**
  
   This allows us to easily trace documentation related to any potential error, which can be particularly crucial when secondary errors arise during regression testing.<br>

 - **Environment**
  
    It is especially important to define the environment in which the error was found. This prevents situations where inappropriate software releases or test environments are being tested.<br>

  - **Steps to reproduce**
   
    The next step involves reproduction steps, which will allow the programmer to confirm the error verification and also assist testers in documenting errors during potential manual regression tests.<br>

- **Results**  

  
**Actual result** ‚Üí  a description of the actual but undesirable behaviour of the system, which by its definition is considered as a defect.


**Expected result** ‚Üí  a description of the result that the system or software should achieve, which is also in line with stakeholders' expectations and project specifications.<br>

- **Attachements**
  
  The final component is attachments, which include any elements that can help visualize the detected defect - these can be in the form of screenshots or videos, helping to avoid unwanted ambiguities or communication errors when reporting such a defect to the programmer.<br>
